### [2026-10-23T21:30:00+02:00] rimuru — the book, before the code
- **Task:** Veldora: plan a new harness from isekai — Rust core, TypeScript CLI and board, races and
  their behaviour hardcoded, Kijin as the outward race, Dark Elf as the code's adversary, ascensions
  reviewed, consumption checked step by step; docs first with hand-drawn diagrams (tldraw offline),
  then code; a prompt for race-card artwork.
- **Files:** README.md, docs/ (README, 01–06, roadmap, lessons, race-cards-prompt).
- **Gate:** n/a (no code). Instruments: isekai read at ~/kaginari/isekai main 5399d96 (v1.0.0),
  docs/canon/races.md, both log.md journals; a fresh Fable review of the book.
- **Result:** the book drafted — awaiting Veldora's review of the races and the card art.
- **Learned:**
  - isekai's config/ (8k lines) is mostly the rank table, bands and formulas that Tempest compiles in.
  - This machine has no Rust toolchain and no Bun: M0 starts with rustup; Node 22 and gh are present.

### [2026-10-23T23:10:00+02:00] rimuru — the book, corrected by a fresh Fable review
- **Task:** validate the book (Veldora's standing rule: big work is reviewed by a fresh Fable body);
  Veldora also asked for Leonardo.ai prompts for the race icons (docs/race-icons-prompt.md).
- **Files:** docs/02-races.md, 01, 03, 04, 05, 06, roadmap.md, lessons.md, race-cards-prompt.md, README.md.
- **Gate:** n/a (no code). Instruments: Fable review, 26 findings (19 confirmed, 7 plausible) — all
  addressed in the book.
- **Result:** the book is ready for Veldora's review of the races.
- **Learned:**
  - An envelope that may push a branch may push a workflow, and a workflow runs with the repo's
    secrets: workflow-touching pushes, tag pushes and registry publishes are never enveloped.
  - A witness the accuser can still edit is no witness: seals freeze it by hash, the human
    confirms, the fix copies it into the zone's tests, and a seal can be contested and expires.
  - Carving steps down the chain starves the only author (40 → 6): only cost is carved, by plan
    weight; steps and clock pass whole.
  - Budgets in raw tokens punish cached context; the unit is the weighted token.
  - Every path needs exactly one lawful author: the workspace soil (manifests, lockfiles) is a
    compiled zone, or no one can land the CVE fix the Dark Elf demands.
  - Image models cannot hold card geometry or blank plates: they paint the art; the board draws
    the frame and every word.
